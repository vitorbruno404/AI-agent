Customer Feedback. Customer feedback is crucial in approving or disputing business model hypotheses.. Customer feedback helps to determine if the value proposition works.. Customer interactions and feedback are used to revise hypotheses.. 4. Financial Viability. The canvas helps to estimate the model's earning potential.. Costs and revenues are calculated, and profit potential is estimated.. Financial scenarios can be run based on different assumptions.. The canvas is used to organize the financial model.. Metrics are used to evaluate the financial model.. 5. Iterating and Pivoting. The canvas is used as a guide to figure out where and how to pivot.. Each time the founders iterate or pivot in response to customer feedback, a new canvas is drawn showing the changes.. The canvas is updated with the results of tests and experiments.. 6. Assessing Fit. The Business Model Canvas is used to explore how a company creates value for customers.. A key aspect of evaluating the Business Model Canvas is to assess the fit between the customer profile and the value map.. The Value Proposition Canvas can be used to ensure that the value proposition is aligned with customer needs.. The fit is evaluated by addressing customers' jobs, pains, and gains.. 7. Strategic Perspectives. The canvas can be used with Blue Ocean Strategy to question value propositions and explore new customer segments..

The business model's position with respect to the external environment is considered.. The business model's evolution in light of a changing environment is assessed.. Stakeholders who might influence the business model are identified.. . In summary, the sources suggest that evaluating a Business Model Canvas is an iterative process involving hypothesis testing, customer feedback, financial analysis, and strategic perspectives, with a focus on continuous learning, adaptation and team alignment.. .
